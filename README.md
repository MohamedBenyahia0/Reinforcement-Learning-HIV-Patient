# Project: Reinforcement Learning Class Assignment
In this project, I participated in the Reinforcement Learning Class Assignment as part of the M2 - Reinforcement Learning course. The task involved developing a reinforcement learning (RL) agent for a simulation of an HIV patient's immune system. The goal was to design a structured treatment interruption strategy to optimize drug prescriptions while keeping the patient healthy.  


# Challenge Overview:  

The project required implementing and training an RL agent to interact with a simulated HIV patient for at most 200 time steps, with the objective of minimizing drug prescriptions and maximizing immune response. The task was evaluated based on the agent's performance in both a default patient and a population of randomized patients.
